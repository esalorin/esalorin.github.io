			<p class="black"><strong>Hi, I'm Eena!<br/></strong></p>
			<p class="black"><strong>Currently</strong> I'm working as a Junior Software Engineer at Funzi where I'm part if the internal tech team. While working, I'm also studying the degree in Business Information Technology in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences. I'm excited to get study more and combine other skills with coding.</p>
			<p class="black"><strong>My background:</strong> I graduated from high school in 2016. In high school I enjoyed math and I realized problem 
				solving/logical thinking is my advantage. When the new kind of coding school Hive Helsinki was launched, I was interested right away.</p>
				<p class="black">In October 2019 I started my studies in Hive Helsinki. The first programming language I started my studies with was C.
				Studying a low level language reallyÂ gives a deep understanding what is happening "under the hood". If I had started with some high-level 
				language I may not know this much about memory management and many other things.</p>
				<p class="black">In Hive we have different branches where to choose from and each of those are focusing on different skills. At the first, I was studying Unix/system branch where I had to create 
				my own shell and shell related programs.<br/>Last autumn I decided to change the branch and currently I'm working on the web branch. Web branch includes three different and fun projects where you learn to build web applications. In the first project I used HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend and PHP for the backend. I have also added some Ajax there. Right know I'm working on the second project Matcha which is group project. We are creating dating site with React and Node.</p>
