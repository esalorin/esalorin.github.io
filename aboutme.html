			<p class="black"><strong>Hi, I'm Eena,<br/></strong>  23 years old student living in Helsinki.</p>
			<p class="black"><strong>I graduated</strong> from high school in 2016. In high school I enjoyed math and I realized problem 
				solving/logical thinking is my advantage. When the new kind of coding school Hive Helsinki was launched, I was interested right away.</p>
				<p class="black"><strong>In October 2019</strong> I started my studies in Hive Helsinki. The first programming language I started my studies with was C.
				Studying a low level language reallyÂ gives a deep understanding what is happening "under the hood". If I had started with some hig-level 
				language I may not know this much about memory management and many other things.</p>
				<p class="black"><strong>In Hive</strong> we have different branches where to choose from and each of those are focusing on different skills. I'm studying Unix/system branch where I'm creating 
				my own shell and shell related programs.<br/>While coding school projects with C, I have also learned some HTML and CSS. Next I'm planning to study maybe Python and/or Java.</p>
				<p class="black"><strong>Currently</strong> I'm looking for internship position and I hope that in autumn 2020 I'll be ready to start my first internship. I'm looking foward to adapt my skills 
					in the real world's problems and learn new things from people who have a lot of experience.</p>
				<p class="black"><strong>In future,</strong> I could see myself working in cyber security related position or as a software developer. Those are one of the things I'm interested in a lot and especially cyber security is going to be 
					even more and more important in the upcoming years. Of course there is a lot of other options and I might end up doing something totally different!</p>
